crate: i3ipc rs

main idea:

Initiate all bars in polybar, via a config file, 
hide all that aren't "default", collect the PID 
for each one of them.

Listen to changes in i3, and if the change is a window one, read it and:

1) show the dummy bar for spacing
2) show the title bar
3) wait an X amount of time
4) hide both bars

The creation of bars must be done via child processes.
